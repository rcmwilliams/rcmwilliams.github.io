				<p><span class="title">about me</span><br>Hey there! I'm a self-identified, geeky nerd. You'll probably find me with my nose in a book, blasting baddies in a video game, or testing my mettle against a horror movie monster. That is to say, I really like stories, and I believe they are an important part of our existence.</p>

			<div class="right" id="where">
				<p><span class="title">where<span id="small">?</span></span><br>Born and raised in the Orlando area, I lived most of my life within the same 10-mile radius. I went to school at the <a href="http://www.ufl.edu">University of Florida</a> -- less than 2 hours from home. After graduating, I traveled to South Korea and spent a year there, teaching ESL. I recently made the big move to Boston/Cambridge to attend <a href="http://boston.startupinstitute.com">Startup Institute Boston</a>.</p>

			<div class="left" id="then">
				<p><span class="title">then</span><br>I spent a lot of my time in college trying to figure out my life direction. That included multiple changes-of-major. It took a while to filter through what was expected of me and what I truly wanted. I decided that it was more important (for me) to do what would ultimately make me happy, rather than what someone else told me I should do. Having grown up on media -- books, movies, TV, video games -- a desire to tell stories grew up with me. I came to realize that "growing up" serves no purpose. Why should I actively give up the things that made me happy? Why would I <span id="italics">choose</span> to do that? Who are you to make me? So instead of following a "traditional" career path, I decided to forge my own -- a path based upon, inspired and influenced by stories.</p>
